We will discuss two different voting applications: First, a question

**What is a p-value?**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(
   "the probability that the null hypothesis is true",
   answer = "the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true",
   "the probability of making an error in your conclusion"
)
```

`r longmcq(opts_p)`
