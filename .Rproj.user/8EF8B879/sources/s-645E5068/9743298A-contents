## This Video: Introduce Stata

By the end of this video, you should be able to:

- Locate and identify the essential parts of the Stata graphics user interface (GUI) \medskip
- Be able to use Stata as a calculator \medskip 
- Be able to use Stata to display string of text


## The Stata Graphical User Interface (GUI)

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/main copy}
\end{center}

## Command Window 

- You can type in code through the command window \medskip

- Pressing enter will execute (or run) the code \medskip

- When we learn how to use Stata as a calculator, this is where we will type the code


## Results Window

- When we execute code, any resulting output will be displayed in the Results window  \medskip

- When we learn how to use Stata as a calculator, this is where the results will be displayed  

## Variables Window

- When we load data (in a future video), the name of the variables in the dataset will appear in the first column

- Many times, datasets come with labels, that give us more description about the variable

- For example, in the figure below there is one variable named ``income`` with the label ``Total Annual Income``

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/example_income.png}
\end{center}

## Properties Window

- This window gives us more information about the variables and data loaded in memory

- For example, in addition to the name and label of a variable, the type (i.e. numeric or string) and format of the variable (i.e. how the variable will be displayed)

- Additionally there is information about the size of the data (number of variables, observations, etc.)

## Using Stata as a calculator

- To use Stata as a calculater you can just type ``display`` followed by a mathematical expression. 

- For example, to compute ``2+2`` type

```{stata}

display 2+2
```

- The result will be visible in the Results window

- ``display`` is called a command in Stata. Stata comes with many commands that will be useful to explore and analyze our data

## Help files

- Commands in Stata come with help files

- To access a help file type ``help display`` into the command window

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/help_display.png}
\end{center}

- This will open up a file that has instructions on how to use the given command

## Syntax

- Computer languages have different syntax

- Syntax refers to the format of the code 

- It is similar to the ``grammar'' of the language

- If you use incorrect grammar in language, you may not be expressing the right meaning

- Similarly, if you use the wrong syntax in computer language, you may not get the correct output, and more than likely, an error will be reported

## Syntax 

- One of the most important parts of a help file is the command syntax 

- This tells you how to use the command

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/help_display.png}
\end{center}

- The fact that ``di`` is underlined means to use the display command you only need to type ``di`` as a shortcut

- We will fill in the ``[display_directive]`` in a couple of ways 

## More calculations

- Subtraction 

```{stata}

di 6-4
```

- Multiplication

```{stata}

di 2*4
```

- Division

```{stata}

di 12/2
```

## Using display to print text

- We can also use ``display`` to print text

- Very helpful when writing programs 

  - For example, if something goes wrong in a program that is written, might want to display an error code
  
- To display the words ``"Hello World"'' type 

```{stata}

display "Hello World"
```

## Some rules with strings

- Words are referred to as strings in Stata (later we will have string variables and numeric variables)

- When you reference a string, need to put in quotation marks. If you forget you will get an error

```{stata}

di Hello World
```

- ``Hello`` was not found because Stata looked for a command or variable named ``Hello``, but could not find one, and therefore reported an error

- The command did not realize it was just meant to display text, because the text was not in quotation marks
