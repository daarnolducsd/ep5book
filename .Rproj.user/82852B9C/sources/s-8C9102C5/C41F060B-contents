## This Video: Describe and Browse

By the end of this video, you should be able to:

- Load data into Stata

- Understand the purpose of the describe and browse command 

## Loading Data

- To load data into Stata, we utilize the "use" command 

- The general syntax is 

\begin{center}
\colorbox{gray!20}{\texttt{use filename.dta, clear}}
\end{center}

- "filename.dta" should be replaced with whatever the name of the file is that you want to load

- "clear" tells Stata to clear anything that is currently loaded into memory

- To use this command "filename.dta" must be in the working directory!

## 

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
cd "/Users/davidarnold/Dropbox/Teaching/EP5/online/02_week/data"
use college_mobility.dta, clear
```

- Now the college mobility data is loaded into memory 

## Describe 

- The ``describe`` command allows us to quickly review the variables in our dataset 

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
describe
```

\end{center}

## Browse

- ``describe`` gives us a good sense of what variables are in the data 

- Many times it is also useful look directly at the data 

- The ``browse`` command opens up a spreadsheet similar to an Excel spreadsheet

- This allows you to look through the data to further understand how the values of each variable are stored
